## Shards

The village of Giampilieri exists in a precarious balance with the mountain that bears its foundations. The rocks that poke out of the ground present a brittle surface that shatters with ease under the chiseling forces of nature. Like a glass bottle in a seastorm; frailty marks the inevitability of this town’s fate.

This repository contains a photogrammetric representation of some of Giampilieri’s landmarks, to archive, preserve, remember and recreate these landmarks in the digital domain.
